### TODO

- ✅ Augment data with batch size 1 :)
- [ ] Support agument a batch of text
- [ ] Execute API calls in parallel
- ✅ Inference with batch size 1 :)
- [ ] Inference with batch size more than 1 :)
- [ ] Support Data Generation to GPU
- [ ] Add 🤗 Accelerate

**API**

- ✅ Support add custom API
- ✅ Calculator API
- ✅ WolframeAlpha API

### Install

Install from PipPy

``` sh
pip install toolformer
```

Install directly from the source code

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/xrsrke/toolformer.git
cd toolformer
pip install -e .
```

### 🤖 Data Generation

``` python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

from toolformer.data_generator import DataGenerator
from toolformer.api import CalculatorAPI
from toolformer.prompt import calculator_prompt
from toolformer.utils import yaml2dict
```

``` python
config = yaml2dict('../configs/default.yaml')
calculator_api = CalculatorAPI(
    "Calculator", calculator_prompt,
    sampling_threshold=0.2, filtering_threshold=0.2
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("bigscience/bloom-560m")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bigscience/bloom-560m")
```

``` python
text = "From this, we have 10 - 5 minutes = 5 minutes."
apis = [calculator_api]
generator = DataGenerator(config, model, tokenizer, apis=apis)
```

``` python
augumented_text_ids = generator.generate(text)
```

``` python
print(tokenizer.decode(augumented_text_ids[0][0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

    From this, we have 10 - 5 minutes = [Calculator(10 - 5)] 5 minutes.

### Add a Custom API?

First, you need to add a new API.

``` python
from toolformer.api import BaseAPI

class WikiSearchAPI(BaseAPI):
    def execute(self, text):
        # your custom api endpoint or whatever
        output = YourCustomAPIEndPoint(text)
        return output
```

Then, create a new prompt template following the form. That’s all!

``` python
from toolformer.prompt import calculator_prompt
print(calculator_prompt)
```


    Your task is to add calls to a Calculator API to a piece of text. The API call should help you get information required to complete the text. 

    You can call the API by writing "Calculator(operation)!" where "operation" is the type of calculation you want to perform. Here are some examples of API calls:

    Input: John has 5 apples and his friend gave him 3 more. John now has 8 apples.
    Ouput: John has 5 apples and his friend gave him 3 more. John now has [Calculator("5 + 3")] 8 apples.

    Input: Jane needs to divide 24 pieces of candy equally among 6 kids. Each kid will get 4 pieces of candy.
    Output: Jane needs to divide 24 pieces of candy equally among 6 kids. Each kid will get [Calculator(24 / 6)] 4 pieces of candy.

    Input: From this, we have 4 * 30 minutes = 120 minutes.
    Output: From this, we have 4 * 30 minutes = [Calculator(4 * 30)] 120 minutes.

    Input: {input}
    Output:
